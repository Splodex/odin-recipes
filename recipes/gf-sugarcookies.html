    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ cups gluten-free flour</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            
        <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
            
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat white sugar, 3/4 cup butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer; beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until mixture is smooth. Mix butter mixture into flour mixture and form dough into a ball. Wrap ball with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            
        <li>Roll dough onto a lightly floured surface and cut into shapes using cookie cutters. Arrange cookies on a baking sheet.</li>
            
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            
        <li>Beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Slowly beat confectioners' sugar into cream cheese mixture until icing is smooth; spread onto cooled cookies.</li>
    </ol>
